# Finance Manager

This is a simple personal finance management app built using **ReactJS**. It helps you track your income and expenses, get a quick summary of your current financial status, and visualize data using charts.

This project started as a way for me to explore how React can be used to build real-world applications. Itâ€™s one of my first full-fledged apps, and through it, I got to practice component-based design, hooks, state management, and working with the browser's local storage for data persistence.

## Features

- Add income and expense entries
- View your balance summary
- Visualize financial data with charts (Chart.js)
- Stores data in the browser using **localStorage**
- Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhee-raj10/finance-manager.git
